[**HTB: Bastion**](./_posts/2019-9-8-bastion.md)  
Bastion is a Windows OS machine on Hackthebox.eu. The box is hardened, but old vulnerabilities still prove to be valuable. It also involves implementing mounts in a creative way to gain a foothold in the box. Once inside, hidden files and a vulnerable program help to escalate privileges.

[**HTB: Active**](./_posts/2019-9-27-active.md)  
Active had active directory exploitation, hence the name Active. It was a fun & easy machine from boot to root; from using anonymous login on SMB to gain user, to kerberoasting to gain root. Overall a good machine
