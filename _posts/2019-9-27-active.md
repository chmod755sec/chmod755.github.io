# Summary
SMB had anonymous login enabled, which gave me access to the `Replication`
sharename. From there I was able to find a file called `Groups.xml` which had a hash & user
stored inside of it. The encryption method used to encrypt the hash is not secure, and can
easily be decoded. The password can then be used to login to the `Users` sharename to
grab the user.txt file. 

Once I got valid creds in the `Active` domain, I was able to use a script to
enumerate other users in the domain, and grab their password which is hashed. The
encryption method used is `krb5tgs`, which is most times insecure if the password is less then 12 chars.
In hopes of the password being weak, I used hashcat to brute it -- 20 seconds later and I've
got the password. From there I was able to use `psexec` to get an interactive shell on the
target machine.

# Exploitation
As usual i'm going to add the ip `10.10.10.100` to my `/etc/hosts/` as `active.htb`, lets get
started !

Same as every other box, lets start with a `nmap` scan to check for any open ports:  
![Image](/assets/active/active.ctb-001.png)

Quite alot of information is getting leaked through all these open ports. There aren't many
services that allow user interaction, and since I didn't get much information on SMB, that'll be
the first service i'll be looking into:

The only sharename we can access is `Replication`:

A little bit of digging later, and i've found a file called “Groups.xml", use the command `get
Groups.xml` to transfer it over to local:

Location:
`\active.htb\policies\{31B2F340-016D-11D2-945F-00C04FB984F9}\MACHINE\Preferences\Groups`

Contents of `groups.xml`:

`groups.xml` is part of a thing called GPP. Here's a snippet from a article about GPP:
>"GPP was introduced with the release of Server 2008 and allows for configuration of Domainattached machines via group policy. Domain machines periodically reach out and
authenticate to the Domain Controller utilizing the Domain credentials of the logged-in user
(these can be, and often are, unprivileged accounts) and pull down policies." Source: “https://
toshellandback.com/2015/08/30/gpp/”
We can easily crack the hash inside of groups.xml `cpassword="hash"`, the encryption
method used to encrypt the password is insecure and can easily be decoded by using a tool
that comes pre-packed in kali-linux -- `gpp-decrypt`:

Password: “GPPstillStandingStrong2k18”

We can now use our new found creds and login to the Users SMB:

First flag down, onto root.

# Privesc
Kerberos (The active directory we are pentesting), has a few flaws, one is something called
`SPN Scanning`, here's a quick summary on it:
>"Traditionally, attackers have performed recon using network port scanning, though this is
usually not required on modern networks thanks to use of Active Directory and Kerberos. I
have previously written about “SPN Scanning” for recon which involves requesting specific
Service Principal Name (SPN) types from a Domain Controller (requires a user or computer
account). For the attacker, one of the most useful SPN types to scan for is “SQL” to discover all SQL servers registered in Active Directory. All service types that leverage Kerberos
authentication have SPNs registered in Active Directory since SPNs are required for Kerberos
to work. Once the attacker has a list of Service Principal Names (SPNs) associated with service
accounts, these SPNs can be used to request Kerberos TGS service tickets useful for offline
TGS password cracking." Source https://adsecurity.org/?p=2293

Knowing the above, I was able to find a tool that could enumrate/scan `SPN`. There's quite a
few lines of code for this exploit to work, so i'm just going give the link to the script: https://
github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket/blob/master/examples/GetUserSPNs.py.
Running the script:  
![Image](/assets/active/active.ctb-008.png)

The hash is Kerberos 5 encrypted -- hashcat should easily be able to crack this.. Here's the
command I used:
```
hashcat -m 13100 krb6.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --force
```
Hashcat Output:

And as you can see the password for Administrator is `Ticketmaster1968`. Onto getting an
interactive shell.

We can use a tool called “psexec” to get a interactive shell on the target system. There's a
bunch of other tools that are very helpful while pentesting Windows, and here's the github link
to them: https://github.com/SecureAuthCorp/impacket. Once that's installed you can go to
`filelocation/impacket/examples` and run the `psexec.py` script with theses arguments to
gain a interactive shell:

Pretty fun root.. Learned quite alot about pentesting active directories.
